terreSTRIAL has the potential to significantly impact SDG 15 in positive ways by encouraging sustainable practices among its users.
By implementing features like plant provenance verification, it can ensure that plants sold or traded are sourced responsibly and not from protected or degraded areas.
The platform could also include educational resources about sustainable plant cultivation, proper reforestation techniques, and the importance of conserving biodiversity. 
Such measures would align with SDG 15â€™s emphasis on restoring ecosystems and promoting biodiversity.
